I am a French PhD student at the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine. I focus on the dynamics of horizontal transfer of antimicrobial resistance genes between bacteria. My work combines both microbiology and mathematical modelling methods to understand these dynamics.

When I'm not staring at code on my computer screen or culture plates in the lab, I'm a badminton player, video game enthusiast and movie amateur.
